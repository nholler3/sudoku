The beginning of a progressive project. Teaching myself more python and developing my coding skills. I am making a Sudoku game that
will generate a new board every time.

Goals:
- Have a way to complete it/ check that is correct
- ensure there is only one solution
- make it user interactive

The first part of the project was creating the board and beginning to fill the list as needed following the rules of sudoku
